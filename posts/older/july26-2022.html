        ">  As I sit here on the night of my 41st birthday I have to ask the question: So what should 
            this first post really be about? The blog is called Free By Fifty in reality for me, as a
            way to hold myself accountable for my goals. I have the desire to be 100% financially free 
            in nine years. I may get there on time or it may be a little after that, but either way, 
            I will be totally financially free. In truth I have a decent jumpstart to getting there and that's why I
            decided to start writing it now. I see all kinds of stories about people once they're at the
            finish line, but in this case, I'm still running and giving you live updates about the 
            milestones im passing.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I spent months and months looking at other sites
            and even though I found really good info, I wanted others to see what it's like (regardless of
            where they're really at in life), to find a footing and start doing better. But like really really
            better without getting "sold" anything. The purpose of this blog is to share the ways myself and 
            others have obtained financial freedom in order to help you do the same.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Not to knock any other people, I mean in fact i'm really excited to share things i've picked up from many
            other experts along the way, but I usually see more of a giant sales pitch behind many of these stories and
            often pretty vague explanations and theories. But almost never do you see the real road map. The 
            "this is exactly how I got here" story with intricate details. To this point in life I actually floundered
            quite a bit before picking up some things that really made a huge difference, and these were never things
            that I read specifically about. It turns out that many people who have gotten to very high levels of success
            are either really bad at explaining the "how" or scared to divulge the way they actually got there.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            This is exactly what I want to eliminate throughout this blog. No magical stock tips, 
            no zero downbull crap, using family connections, or forgetting to mention large inheritences, 
            riches through lawsuits or any other shady schemes...and definitely no long articles trickling 
            down to a sales pitch. Just pure info about the different ways myself and others like me climbed
            out of the rat race. Something else that I feel is really important is to mention here is the
            amount of control you have over this process. Although you can make money in the stock market...
            you can also make money at a casino, but neither one really gives you the control of what's going on
            happening. I think it is absolutely imperative that the information shared here is tangible.
            If 'you' buy a rental with money 'you' saved and fill it with renters that 'you' find, then you
            have control over those things. But when you 'invest' in something like a stock, at the 
            end of the day, your control is very very minimal.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Since this blog will server not just as a 'How I did it', but also as a how to guide for 
            others, I want to make sure that the information here is as clear as possible, and that it's
            something that you the reader have a large amount of control over. As a final word, I want to
            emphasize the difference between theory and real world, hands on gains along your path to wealth.
            Much of the information is simply things you may not have previously known, or even more to the
            point, unlearning things that you've always said or believed that really aren't true. 'Billionaires
            don't pay their fair share, your house (while you're still paying on it) is your biggest asset, your
            401k is building your retirement', and countless other out and out lies that people say. Most often,
            not maliciously, but because they never really sat down and thought about it. The great thing
            about money and wealth though, is that it's logical and not emotional. Just put the pieces where 
            they belong, and you'll get there. You will absolutely fail along the way, but as long as you're
            failing in an upward direction, you'll learn from those experiences and you will get where you want to
            go. Thank you for reading this blog and I am glad it can bring some real value to your life. I look
            forward to continually adding valuable information here as often as I find it.
