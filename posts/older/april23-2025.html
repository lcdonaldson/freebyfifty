            So, if the goal is to become financially free with passive income, which is getting 
            paid while you’re not working, why would the first big step be for you to add more 
            work and have even less free time?

            It’s a fair question but im going to assume that if you’re reading this with any real intent, 
            that you are not currently rolling in a bunch of excess cash. But I guess even if you were, 
            this might still be a step to take because building a business is more valuable in the 
            beginning than buying one or acquiring it by some other means.
        </p> 
       
        <p style="
            font-size: 1.2em;

            margin-bottom: 1em;
            text-align: left;
        ">
            In either case, the first business is probably the hardest because it combines inexperience 
            with knee jerk reactions. Many people try to build a business with something they already 
            know or are good at, or something they like. Now all of those can have pro columns. But the 
            best kind of business to start is the one that’s needed. You don’t have to like it, in fact 
            you can almost hate it, but how necessary or in demand is it? 
        </p>
        <p style="

            margin-bottom: 1em;
            text-align: left;
        ">
            The other consideration is how big is the lift from starting the business and being the 
            sole worker to offloading that and not really working at  it. Combining those two things 
            to get the right formula is actually quite hard at times. As Henry Ford said “Thinking is 
            the hardest work there is, which is probably the reason why so few engage in it”. I can 
            attest to that. And as a final nail in the coffin, you need to do your best analysis, but 
            don’t over analyze it to the point of paralysis. 
        </p>
        <p style="

            text-align: left;
        ">
            Yeah it’s actually the hardest step in my opinion. Having built and sold several 
            businesses, it can be infuriating to want to just get up and run with it. But doing your 
            homework can change that success ration A LOT.

            How well can the business scale? Some businesses hit walls depending on your area or 
            availability. Do you want to grow something so big you’ll really never get out of it? 
            Because I don’t. I want to grow a micro business that I can grow until profitability and 
            either have a random investor buy it out, or even better, bring someone into the business 
            with the knowledge that they will learn the business and buy you out of it.

        ">
            Regardless of the exact strategy you want to do. I would push for 6 months consistent 
            profitability before starting the process of offloading it or transferring it. I’ve found 
            that if you can achieve 6 months of solid profitability in a necessary industry, the 
            business will likely survive.  
        </p>

            Ok let’s dive into an actual example here pretty quick. But one last aside. Why are we 
            looking at a business where you are working instead of a passive income stream right off 
            the bat? Because of what the business offers you. A business has purchasing power that you 
            likely won’t as an individual. So the main reason isn’t the business itself. But it’s what 
            the business can do for you in the future.

            Alright, here’s an actual example of a micro business that I started, grew, 
            perpetuated to another state, and sold, while maintaining the ability to continue 
            that business in my home state:

            In the desert, western United States there is a very real problem with gophers. Yes those 
            little tunnel rats that wreak havoc not just on flower beds but serious agricultural problems 
            as well as golf courses, orchards, etc.

            Well about 15 years ago I discovered the absolute secret to consistently catching these guys. 
            It was the age ole “build a better mouse trap” problem, but instead of building a better one, 
            all you had to do was buy the right ones, and it made all the difference. It was absolutely 
            unreal how much better simply switching to a different (and yes slightly more expensive) trap 
            could be. The catch rate went up nearly 100%. So it was a game changer.

            margin-bottom: 1em;
            text-align: left;
        ">
            But the reason for the business wasn’t discovering the secret. It was proving to people that 
            I could do it more effectively than previous attempts. The issue was finding the right 
            clientele. There was always people willing to pay to remove them, but who was really affected 
            in a way that they would pay big dollars for consistent work?
        </p>
        <p style="

            margin-bottom: 1em;
            text-align: left;
        ">
            My first thought was farmers, and while it was true that they were the most affected and 
            most eager to have their problems solved. They also had the tightest pocket books. You 
            had to squeeze every last dime from them, and the jobs became increasingly difficult over 
            bigger and bigger areas. But golf courses and schools were the ticket. Reliable, consistent 
            work and they were easy to work with.

            It took a few years (remember this is all side hustle, not my regular 9-5) to get all that 
            knowledge and experience together but when it all came together it was worth it. 
            Finding young men that wanted to do the work was also a plus. Many young people had chaotic 
            schedules with school and activities so getting gophers was the ticket for them. Part time 
            work with pretty solid pay. I finally found someone out of state who wanted to do it on a real 
            full time basis. So I sold the business.  
        </p>
        <p style="

            margin-bottom: 1em;
            text-align: left;
        ">
            They way I sold the business was probably the only real mistake I made, because I just did a 
            lump sum + a payment plan which quickly ran out. 
        </p>

            The <b>real lesson</b> here wasn’t in starting or even growing the business but in the fact 
            that I didn’t retain any ownership of it. Now I was at least careful enough to not sell the 
            name, and also maintained the ability to continue the same business in my own state, while 
            not competing with the buyer in their state. But I would have been in a much better position 
            had I retained a small percentage of ownership. The business still exists today and would be 
            an added lever to pull because anything over two years operation with profitability is a gold 
            mine to use for bank loans. On a personal level I would likely not qualify for some passive 
            income purchases like a rental house, but a business owner or investor might.

            We will dive further into the details on this in the future to really dissect how starting 
            turns to sales, which starts creating logistics, expenses rise, and you face growth problems. 
            But for now, think of how simple removing a garden pest can become a business. How you can 
            train others to become the employees, and so forth.

            The biggest help early on that I can give you is to really understand how to TRIAGE a
