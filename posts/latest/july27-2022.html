        ">  She honestly can't help her self. She means well, she really does. But my mother-in-law has an
            almost psychotic NEED to move things around in a house. My house, her house, your house, VRBO rentals, hotels
            and if you stand to long at the DMV...there too. But she's not unique. Everyone has something they
            do almost compulsively. It can be a strength at certain times, but there is one scenario where it 
            is a true weakness...Trying to build wealth on false ideas about money.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Let's quickly step back and do a 30 thousand foot view about this before we dive into the particulars 
            though. What is money. I mean what is it really about? Well our money (US dollar) isnt actually money at all.
            Our bills are 'Notes'. To be precise they are Federal Reserve Notes from the US treasury.
            
            <div class="imageOneWrapper">
                <img src="/assets/img/dollar.png" alt="Federal Reserve Note" height="250" width="600"/>
            </div>
            <br/>
            <br/>

            You'll notice in the top left corner it says "this note is legal tender for all debts public and private."
            Seeing this you may say "see, that's money right there. It says you can use this note to pay for anything."
            But there is a small difference in what's going on here. The note is just an I owe you. In times past, this 
            note functioned as a lighter placeholder to be used in place of actual money (gold, silver, etc). Because 
            for many years our dollars were backed by gold. What this means in common terms is that they took actual gold and
            printed off a certain number of dollars to equal the value of that gold stored away. This made paper dollars
            actually worth something. Your paper dollar represented a fraction of gold. If you had enough of them
            you could actually trade them for gold. That's why the US dollar was the 'gold standard' for money.

            The problem came in 1971 though when Richard Nixon changed the US dollar from money to a currency. Meaning,
            he ordered that
