        ">  So not long after I had the last lapse in time I got kinda angry about being 40 and not having
        really done a lot with starting a business. It kinda festered for a few days and then one day I was
        making our yearly pomegranate jelly and I said, screw it, im going to sell some of these. 
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I had always wanted to have a business called (well I wont say what it was in case I have to create a new entity someday),
            but it was a cool name about flourishing in farming. I was so happy about it and both my wife and 
            daughter were like.....no that's stupid. I couldn't get them on board for anything. So I resolved 
            to change the name to something more local. I really liked Harvest Central Farms because we're trying
            to buy land in Central Arizona. Again wife, daughter and finally polling about 10 other people, they
            didn't like the order, and said switch it to Central Harvest Farms. So after a ridiculous amount of 
            effort, Central Harvest Farms was born. My wife was not much more than the voice of criticizm about
            most of my past efforts, but as soon as I mentioned the need for a logo she went into overdrive. She 
            has done lots of design work for crafts on a Silhouette machine for years and it had a lot of features 
            she could work with.
            <br/>
            
        </p>
        <div style="text-align:center;">
            <h3> We came up with two designs. The first is our company logo</h3>
            <img src="/assets/img/business_logo.png" alt="business_logo" style="width: 80%;">
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <h3>The other is a brand logo for marketing </h3>
            <img src="/assets/img/market_logo.png" alt="market" style="width: 80%;">
           
        </div>

        <p style="
            font-size: 14pt;
            color: #414a4f;
            font-family: 'Open Sans';
            margin-bottom: 35px;
            margin-top: 35px;
            text-align: left;
        "> 
            So after that it really kinda took off. I made a facebook page 
            <em>
                <a href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100086140816763">Central Harvest Farms</a>
            </em> that day and then started selling everything I could find. Jelly, Herbs, Wreaths, Duck eggs,
            microgreens, canned fruit, etc. I ordered about $400 worth of Elephant Garlic and planted it. Built a chicken
            tractor (yes thats a thing), which is basically a movable pen. Then I purchased 24 ducks for 
            meat and eggs. Before long several people got interested in our products and orders. So I purchased 
            a website domain and will launch an ecommerce site next year. Even our local paper took an interest.

            All in all it's been a great side hustle. I still have my day job but it's given me a good 
            start into the business world. It has the possible to open lots of doors and as I grow this 
            business I look forward to sharing the successes and failures. It's just one more stream,
            although not really passive, of income to help me accumulate enough to start purchasing 
            passive assets. I belive the snowball effect will really happen at that stage.
