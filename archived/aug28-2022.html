        ">  So one of the reasons I stated for this blog was accountability to post content 
        regularly and on time. Then right after my last post I got sick. Not like hey, 
        taking the day off sick. Like, let's get our affairs in order kinda sick. 
        It was a combination of several things, but essentially like getting the 
        flu + sinus infection + ghandi's 7 day diet challenge all
        at once. It was the kinda sick you wouldn't really wish on your enemies. And it had 
        lasting effects. It had me down for several weeks.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            Then just as things were looking better. I had the distinct pleasure of 
            gowing through floods....in Arizona and New Mexico. Yeah, you read that right, 
            floods, 100 year type floods. Taking bridges, happiness and the desire to blog with it.
            <br/>

            <h3> Duncan AZ </h3>

            So yeah, real life kinda stuff. I may indeed be free by fifty, but im not exempt from 
            the kind of celestial lottery that visits us all. This flooding is the kind of thing 
            that money alone can't fix...it helps, but it also takes serious time and planning to 
            rebuild from these types of disasters. Being a willing and able body is half the battle
            when things like this happen. People just need the physical help to have supplies
            transported to them, communications maintained in their lives and evacuation when needed.
            It's a big deal. I'll post updates as they happen.
